# Abstract

I built this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React/Vite). The code can be seen [here](https://github.com/zachvin/portfolio-app). These are important skills for a machine learning engineer because even the most powerful neural networks can be rendered ineffective if interacting with them is not simple and reliable. By learning to build modular, interactive, and clean web interfaces, I can improve the reach and influence of models that I train and be better prepared for building the scalable AI solutions that modern businesses need.
