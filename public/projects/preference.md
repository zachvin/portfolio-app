# Abstract

This project is a competition that I participated in during the fall of 2024. The purpose is to detect whether a latent user preference exists in a user's query and corresponding LLM output. For example, if the user asks for a recipe, the latent preference is "step-by-step instructions", and the LLM outputs instructions, then the latent user preference is present in the LLM's output. Models like these are necessary because they help align LLMs with human goals. I finished third out of ten participating teams.
